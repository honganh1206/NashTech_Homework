# Implicit wait
An implicit wait tells WebDriver to give the DOM a certain amount of time 
when trying to find any element (or elements) not immediately available.

# Explicit wait
An explicit wait is a code you define to wait for a certain condition to occur 
before proceeding further in the code 

# Differences
## 1
Implicit waits are more like general waits for everything (wait at most X seconds for every element you interact with).
Explicit waits are specific waits for something to happen or until time elapses (wait for X seconds until this button is clickable/visible).

## 2
Implicit wait adds extra wait time and can overwrite explicit waits if unexpected. 

## 3
An implicit wait is a single line of code that applies to everything for that session, easier to code, and more prone to failure.
Explicit waits waits for specific conditions 
(you can wait for a button to be clickable or a label to visible, requires more coding but you can adjust the waits to what you need) 

## Conclusion
Avoid implicit wait and use explicit wait.

Write wait methods using explicit wait method to wait:
• Wait for an element is displayed

        public IWebElement ReturnWebElement(By by)
        {
            IWebElement e = _driver.FindElement(by);
            _wait.Until(SeleniumExtras.WaitHelpers.
                ExpectedConditions.ElementIsVisible(by));
            return e;
        }

• Wait for an element is clickable


        public IWebElement ReturnWebElement(By by)
        {
            IWebElement e = _driver.FindElement(by);
		_wait.Until(SeleniumExtras.WaitHelpers.
   			 ExpectedConditions.ElementToBeClickable(by));
		return e;
        }

• Wait for an element is selected

        public IWebElement ReturnWebElement(By by)
        {
            IWebElement e = _driver.FindElement(by);
		_wait.Until(SeleniumExtras.WaitHelpers.
    			ExpectedConditions.ElementToBeSelected(by));
		return e;
        }
